    abstract = { ABSTRACTThe routine maintenance and rehabilitation of road pavement is vital to keep up with the service level and bearing capacity. However, the current problem is that, with the continuous increase of the scale of maintenance data, the traditional decision-making cannot satisfy the requirements in terms of accuracy and efficiency. The objectives of this paper were to improve the accuracy and efficiency of the maintenance decisions, overcome the decision error caused by insufficient human experience, and develop the mapping process for decision plans. This paper presented a decision-making method for asphalt pavement maintenance using improved weight random forest algorithm (IWRF) based on the correlation analysis (CA) and the analytic hierarchy process (AHP). Firstly, appropriate features were selected through CA of road detection data, and then decision trees were constructed based on Bootstrapping. Finally, qualified decision trees were chosen and weighted by AHP to form a random forest. To examine the feasibility, the algorithm was applied in a maintenance decision of the 80â€…km highway in Jiangsu province. The results showed that IWRF had a decision-making accuracy of up to 90\%. Comparing with the traditional random forest algorithm, the IWRF algorithm had a 4.35\% higher accuracy and saved 75\% computation time. }
